<p>This can be implemented by barangays in focusing on proper waste disposal, recycling, and active participation in community clean-up efforts to significantly reduce litter and prevent flooding. By organizing regular clean-up events and promoting responsible waste disposal, we can help maintain a cleaner and safer environment. Implementing waste management can be achieved through education campaigns, providing accessible waste disposal bins, and encouraging recycling programs at the community level</p>
